# WhatAmIWatching
Shows what you're watching on Discord


# NodeJS

# Setup
This requires NodeJS to be installed to work.

First download the repository by hitting "Clone/Download"

Second open a terminal window in that directory and type in "npm install" and this will install all the required files to run.
Then double click the "firefox.bat" file to run the server so you can do the next step.

Third, go to FireFox and go to https://localhost:8080 and it should give a "SELF_SIGNED_CERT" error, don't worry this is supposed to happen, simply trust the site and if it infintly loads localhost:8080 then it worked. You can close the tab and continue on to the next step.

Fourth, install the Add on for firefox that communicates with this app to send data. You can download it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/what-am-i-watching/

Fifth, you're basically done. To run the app double click the "firefox.bat" file which will open up fire fox and a command prompt window. If the window does not say "Running!" then please make an issue describing what happened.

Zeroith, hit the green button up there that says "Clone/download" and hit download as zip and unzip it to your desktop or wherever you please.

Easier to set up than that NodeJS thing right?
