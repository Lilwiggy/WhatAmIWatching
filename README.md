Shows what you're watching on Discord

# Setup
This is the C# version of of What Am I Watching. It's easier for Windows users to use.


Zeroith, hit the green button up there that says "Clone/download" and hit download as zip and unzip it to your desktop or wherever you please.

First, install the Add on for firefox that communicates with this app to send data. You can download it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/what-am-i-watching/

Second, you can either just double click "What am I watching.exe" located in "src C#" or you can right click it and make a shortcut on your desktop (Recommended).
And it should say "Ready!" and you are set.

Easier to set up than that NodeJS thing right?
