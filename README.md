# Setup
This requires NodeJS to be installed to work.

First download the repository by hitting "Clone/Download"

Second open a terminal window in that directory and type in "npm install" and this will install all the required files to run.

Third, install the Add on for firefox that communicates with this app to send data. You can download it here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/what-am-i-watching/

Fourth, you're basically done. To run the app double click the "firefox.bat" file which will open up fire fox and a command prompt window. If the window does not say "Running!" then please make an issue describing what happened.
